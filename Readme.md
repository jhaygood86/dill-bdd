# Description
`dill-bdd` (Dill BDD Library) is an unopinionated library to build behavior tests using the Gherkin DSL and run tests using mstest or any other test framework.

It is compatible with cucumber.io compatible feature files (Gherkin) that use a natural language syntax for defining integration tests It is not a full match of cucumber features.

The library is very small, and only concerned with running behavior tests using the Gherkin language.
