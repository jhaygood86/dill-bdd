# Description
`dill-bdd` (Dill BDD Library) is an unopinionated library to build behavior tests using the Gherkin DSL and run tests using mstest or any other test framework.

It is compatible with cucumber.io compatible feature files (Gherkin) that use a natural language syntax for defining integration tests.

The library is very small, and only concerned with running behavior tests using the Gherkin language. 

Original author: Justin Haygood and used on Videa-tv production solutions.
